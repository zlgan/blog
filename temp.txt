要查询当前数据库中未提交的事务，你可以使用以下SQL查询：

```sql
SELECT
    r.session_id,
    r.transaction_id,
    r.database_id,
    t.name AS 'Transaction Name',
    r.status,
    r.command,
    r.wait_type,
    r.wait_time,
    r.percent_complete,
    r.estimated_completion_time,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
INNER JOIN sys.dm_tran_session_transactions t
ON r.session_id = t.session_id;
```

这个查询会返回当前数据库中正在执行的事务的相关信息，包括事务ID、数据库ID、事务状态等等。你可以根据需要进一步筛选未提交的事务。
